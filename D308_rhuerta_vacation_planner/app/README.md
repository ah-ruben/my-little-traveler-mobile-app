# Application Name - My Little Traveler
The purpose of this application is to allow users to keep track of and plan their vacations and any associated excursions during 
their vacation time. The user will be able to add as many vacations and excursions as they'd like. 

## App Use
When the application is opened, you are presented with the home screen where you have the option to hit 'Enter' to begin. Upon
choosing to enter, you will be shown an empty list where vacations will be saved to. In order to create a vacation, there are
two options - the first is to click the bottom right arrow to go to the next screen, the second is to hit the top left menu and 
click 'Add Vacation'. These actions will both take you to the activity to add a vacation with a title, accommodation, and start and 
end dates. To successfully add an excursion to a vacation, you must save the vacation using the top right menu option and selecting
'Save Vacation', under the same menu there is an option to delete, share, and notify yourself about a vacation when its starting and
when its ending. In the vacation and excursion details, there is a '+' button to associate a new excursion to the vacation. Similar
to vacations, the excursion details menu allows you to save the excursion title and date of the excursion. To save an excursion,
you can click the top right menu and click 'Save Excursion', the same menu will also provide options to delete, share, and notify
you when they excursion is starting. Navigating back to the vacation details screen with the back arrow at the top left, you will 
now see an excursion associated to your vacation if one was saved. Hitting the back arrow again, you will see a vacation on your 
vacation list screen.
